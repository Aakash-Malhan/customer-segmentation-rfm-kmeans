# customer-segmentation-rfm-kmeans
Customer segmentation web app (RFM + KMeans) with auto-k selection, Gradio UI, and downloadable CSV outputs.

Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/aakash-malhan/customer-segmentation-rfm-kmeans

Objective:

Convert raw retail transactions into actionable customer segments.

Use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to capture purchase behavior.

Auto-select K (number of clusters) via silhouette score; label segments with human-friendly names.

Produce downloadable outputs suitable for CRM, lifecycle marketing, and experimentation.

Key Takeaways:

Top Spenders (e.g., High-Value Loyalists) carry outsized revenue; protect with VIP perks and priority support
.
Frequent Actives respond well to cross-sell and new arrivals; sustain cadence with low-friction offers.

Promising Growers need nudges to increase purchase frequency/size (bundles, thresholds, free shipping).

At-Risk Dormants require reactivation (win-back emails, time-bound discounts, replenishment reminders).

Outputs are ready for action: you can import the assignments into CRM or ad platforms for targeting.

Business Impact:

Revenue Uplift: Targeted promos to top-value segments drive higher AOV and LTV versus blanket campaigns.

Churn Reduction: Early detection of at-risk cohorts enables timely win-back flows.

Marketing Efficiency: Suppress disengaged segments, focus paid budget on high-propensity groups.

Experimentation Velocity: CSV outputs plug into A/B testing; track uplift per segment and iterate fast.

Stakeholder Clarity: Plain-English segment names make it easy for non-technical teams to align on strategy.
